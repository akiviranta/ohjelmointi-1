The pinnacle of what i learned during the first programming course at tampere university. I also converted this game to having a GUI with a friend, I dont have the code
so it is not here. This is a basic version of the classis sink-a-ship game. If this was to be sold (like there arent any other versions of this already) the reading of the
ships should be done with some other mechanisms than just reading from a pre filled file.
